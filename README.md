# RMPL
Implementation of different RMP algorithm in various languages.

If you want to contribute to existing module, you should raise a issue regarding that new thing. The mentors will approve the request only then you will be allowed to push the changes.

If you want to add something new to the library, feel free to discuss it with mentors first. 

If you are creating any new repository,  do add the description, algorithm and usage of that algorithm in a Readme file. If mentor feels that work is already present in the existing repositories, he may discard your work, after giving a warning. Do check the repository propoperly before submission. Code should be purely object oriented and well commented. 

If you are taking some portion of your code from some source, do mention that properly.
